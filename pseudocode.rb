# For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

#     a method that returns the sum of two integers
#     a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
#     a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

# No need to code here, just practice writing logic out in English.

# a method that returns the sum of two integers

# START
# SET int1 to GET integer 1
# SET int2 to GET integer 2
# SET result to int1 + int 2
# PRINT result
# END

# a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

# START
# SET string = empty string
# WHILE given array != nil
# READ given array of strings at first index position
# SET string to + first index position DELETING first index position
# PRINT string
# END

# a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

# START
# SET odd_arr = empty array
# READ given array beginning at index position 0
# odd_arr =
#  IF array index = odd
#   NEXT
#   ELSE SELECT
#     NEXT
#   END
# END
# PRINT odd_arr
