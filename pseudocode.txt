For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

    a method that returns the sum of two integers
    a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
    a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

No need to code here, just practice writing logic out in English.

a method that returns the sum of two integers

START
SET int1 to GET integer 1
SET int2 to GET integer 2
SET result to int1 + int 2
PRINT result
END
